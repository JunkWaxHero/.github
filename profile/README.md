## Our Mission :dart:

**Junk Wax Hero** is dedicated to democratizing access to baseball card data. While we offer premium API services for developers, businesses, and collectors, we are committed to making our core baseball card database freely available through our open-source initiative.

Our goal is to create a friendly, collaborative ecosystem where enthusiasts, developers, and data scientists can access and contribute to a growing collection of data files, machine learning models, and artificial intelligence tools centered around baseball cards.

## Open Source Commitment :open_hands:

We believe in open data and collaboration. Our entire database of baseball cards is made **open source and available to everyone for free**. This commitment stands at the core of our mission to democratize access to baseball card data.

## What is the Junk Wax Era? :calendar:

The Junk Wax Era refers to a period in baseball card history, primarily in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when overproduction led to a glut of baseball cards.
