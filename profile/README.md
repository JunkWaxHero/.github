# Welcome to Junk Wax Data! :baseball:

**Junk Wax Data** is an open-source initiative dedicated to preserving and sharing comprehensive datasets for baseball cards from the Junk Wax Era. Our mission is to create a friendly, collaborative space where enthusiasts, developers, and data scientists can access and contribute to a growing collection of data files, machine learning models, and artificial intelligence tools centered around this nostalgic era of baseball cards.

## Our Goals :dart:

1. **Open Datasets**: Provide high-quality, structured datasets for Junk Wax baseball cards, including detailed card lists, variations, and attributes.
2. **Machine Learning Models**: Develop and share machine learning models that can analyze, classify, and even predict card values or trends.
3. **Artificial Intelligence Tools**: Create AI-driven tools that can assist in tasks such as card recognition, price prediction, and more.
4. **Community Collaboration**: Build a community where contributors can share knowledge, tools, and ideas to further the understanding and appreciation of Junk Wax baseball cards.

## What is the Junk Wax Era? :calendar:

The Junk Wax Era refers to a period in baseball card history, primarily in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when overproduction led to a glut of baseball cards. Despite this, the era holds significant nostalgic value for collectors and hobbyists. Our goal is to make data from this era accessible and useful for a wide range of applications.

## How You Can Get Involved :handshake:

We welcome contributors of all skill levels! Whether you're a developer, data scientist, or simply a baseball card enthusiast, there are many ways to get involved:

- **Contribute Data**: Share card lists, images, or other relevant data. :file_folder:
- **Develop Models**: Help create machine learning models or AI tools that work with our datasets. :robot:
- **Build Tools**: Develop apps, games, or utilities that make use of our open data. :wrench:
- **Spread the Word**: Share our mission with others who may be interested in contributing or using the data. :loudspeaker:
